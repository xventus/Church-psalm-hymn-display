# controller

Remote control for the display. The controller is based on atmega328p. For its operation it requires a connected numeric keypad, which communicates via PS/2 and is connected to USB. Not all USB numeric keyboards can communicate this way. 

The DOC directory contains the schematic and STL for the box.
